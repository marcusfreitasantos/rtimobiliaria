# RT Imobiliária
This is a website made for a real estate company and it needed to be integrated to a mySql database in order to get lists of data and show on the front-end.

## About the project
I made this project using php in order to work with sql database. I made the connection in one file called databaseconnection.php and import it in the other files. The website has lists of the data from database and also a search form.
There is also the contact page that can send HTML e-mails directly to the e-mail host.

#Deploy
I deploy this on the company host and you can see it working here [RT Imobiliária](https://rtimobi.com/site).

## Built with
PHP | Bootstrap | JavaScript | MySQL
